# Hackability@Sherlock

This is the official repo for the **Hackability@Sherlock** project. 

The goal is to develop a 3D printed design object which easily lets visually impaired people get a quick and informative audio description of a small indoor space - such as an hotel room, to get an understanding of where and which objects are present in the room.

Sherlock will be composed of the following components:
* an audio speaker
* an electronic circuit to "read" the user's input (through the pressing of buttons)
* a Raspberry Pi to control everything
* a 3D printed casing, with buttons and Braille text

We will try to make Sherlock as simple and yet configurable as possible, where users can just drag-and-drop their audio tracks to be reproduced and Sherlock will be able to reproduce them.

Our vision is to create an object which integrates well into any environment and is able to feel any people welcome and at home in any new indoor space.
